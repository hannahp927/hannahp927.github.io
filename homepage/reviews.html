Even my most esteemed confidant, Patrick Star, whose abdomen has been habitually refrerred to as a oceaseless void, refuses to partake of the foodstuffs that this bakery has the audacity to administer to its customers. I shall advise you: refrain from frequenting this establishment if you value your well being.</td>

                <td>The 6 and the Q trains have just pulled into the station and people flood out onto 86th street,  pushing, shoving, and running across the intersection before the M86 runs them over. Amongst all this there is a bakery called Two Little Red Hens. It looks completely different from the rest of the street, with its small red and white striped awning and rickety wooden door. In its one window there are porcelain decorations and a bouquet of colorful flowers inviting you in to view the display case filled with cakes, cupcakes, pies, scones, muffins, and bread. Upon entry, the little bell hanging off the door jingles and the smell of chocolate and butter fills your nose. This oasis is held between red brick walls lined with chalk board menus whose writing glows in the warm lighting shining down from the ceiling. During the holiday seasons, the fall or winter decorations create an even better atmosphere than the holidays themselves. The bakery is one room, apart from the kitchen that’s hidden behind two red and white gingham curtains.The customers of Two Little Red Hens are all there not only for the desserts, but to make memories. They all want the warm embrace of the bakery and the safety and comfort of the space. Which is exactly why the bakery doesn’t actually have any of that. All the people flood into the bakery, packing the room so tightly that a small step out of the line is impossible. And to make matters worse, the person behind me won’t stop inching forward as if that would make the line move faster anyway. There’s so many conversations happening at once that I can’t hear my mind lecture me on how stupid I’ll look if I mess up my order and hold up the line of rabid upper eastsiders. Behind the counter is no better, with the employees frantically delivering cakes only to be yelled at by a customer. I’ve never dared to, but if you came the day before Thanksgiving, then you would have to wait in the line stretching all the way to First Avenue just to get a glimpse of a pie. All these people come here believing they are unique and that their experience here is only theirs. They might come for different reasons, but to me they’re all the same. There’s the families with their “precious” children who won’t stop crying because they got the wrong cupcake or they need to go potty. The parents want to get in and out and would run you down with their massive strollers if necessary. Next would be the people who only come to get an aesthetic photo of their cupcake up against the red brick walls and chalk menus. Finally, those who come alone either to buy a surprise for someone’s birthday or because they had a long day and want sugar to make them feel better. But regardless of who is in front of me or behind me, I don’t want them to be there. No matter how many times I’ve been told no one in New York is watching me or cares what I’m doing, I still don’t believe it. New York is a place full of diverse, caring, and open minded people who all need to piss off and give me some space. I love New York and I want other people to have the same great experiences as I’ve had, but I also want them to leave because they can ruin these experiences for me. When I come to Two Little Red Hens, I want a calm serene bakery. I want to feel at ease and comforted by the cozy little shop, but that is not what Two Little Red Hens really is. Instead, it’s just crowded beyond belief because everyone wants that feeling too. Granted, when I’m there I do get a dessert, and those desserts make meaningful memories. I can’t imagine a birthday without a Brooklyn Blackout cake sitting before me, coated in glowing candles. New York is the same way. Every Christmas I get so excited to go see the tree in Rockefeller Center, but when I get there I’m instantly ready to leave. And yet, I keep coming back. The past few years when I haven’t been able to see the tree because of the pandemic have felt so empty. New York has given me all these unique memories, shared with me by millions of strangers.</td>
